# üçÉSimple Spring Boot App
Simple web app that manages students with implemented RESTful API.

## Used dependencies
Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver 

## Database
I used PostgreSQL, the database needs to be set up manually.<br>
All database connection properties are contained in "src/main/resources/application.properties", naturally.<br>
Database name is "student" (lowcaps).<br>
Change username and password to yours, if needed (it probably is needed).<br>

## Credits
App created with a huge help of this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SGDpanrc8U <br>
It's not 1:1, cause I changed few things I considered weird.
